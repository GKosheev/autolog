# Project Proposal

Pod Members: Deland Chen, Wynee Pintado, and Enzo Falone 

## Problem Statement

Currently, auto body shops need a smooth, simple, and accessible, online interface for easier business management as well as better communication with their clients and suppliers. There aren’t many applications that serve their needs of determining the availability of supplies necessary to complete a repair job—and those that exist are either outdated or too complex for small businesses. Our focus will be on making this service a reality for small businesses.

## Description

Our goal is to develop an app that would allow business owners to know what supply availability by filtering for part name/number, price, seller, supplies, and purchase date. 

## Expected Features List
Access levels
  - Different authorizations for types of employees (ex: cashier wouldn't need the same editing abilities as a floor manager)

Scan barcode of shipments that arrive.
  - Leans more towards shipped products as auto parts are sorted by part numbers, providing users an extra accessibility feature
  - We will try to include as many other forms of product identification as we can (UPC, ISPN, etc)
  
Inputting product details
  - By default, it will ask the user to input the date the product was bought, the supplier, how much it was, what the item was, and if it was for a car, what vehicle it was for
  - Optional choice to input more detailed info such as the category, customer details, if we were offered a discount for it, original retail price, and          additional notes.
  
Data Report Generator
  - Calculate the supply costs, net/gross profit, and many other measurements (generate a profit report)
  - Any other reports that would be helpful.
  
Checklist and Reminders
- Helps keep business owners on track. A checklist would allow businesses to set up a list of parts/supplies they need to order. 
- Reminders to notify owners when they need to order. Could automatically be set based on previous data and order times.

Additional Basic CRUD features
  - Update inventory data
  - Delete inventory data feature

## Related Work

This application will be a competitor for SAP Business Software; offering an easy and quick way to set up a system to store inventory data in the cloud and getting accurate descriptions for most popular OEM items in the part market for the accessibility of employees. Our product will ensuring greater efficiency and ease in inventory management 

Our application stands out because we're targeted towards small businesses. Competitors like SAP Business Software are way too complex, outdated, and costly ($100s / month in subscriptions) for the average small to midsized business owner. Our focus is supporting small business owners and providing them with a simple UI but powerful tool.

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?
 - How do we integrate different product identification reading features?
 - What kind of reports would be most helpful for businesses?
 - How do we further seperate ourselves from products that already exist?
