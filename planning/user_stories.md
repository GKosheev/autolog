# Project Proposal

Pod Members: Deland Chen, Enzo Falone, Wynee Pintado

## Problem Statement

Small business auto shop owners lack a simple, easy-to-use, and affordable software to manage their inventory. Competitors are geared towards larger businesses and charge enormous monthly fees. Our goal is to create a immediately usable (plug-and-play), cheap, but powerful tool.

## User Roles

“Owner”: all the below, Can update, read, create, and delete. Can also delete the database. (CRUD + deleting database) <br>
“Manager”: all the below, able to cancel, return, add orders and items (CRUD)<br>
“Employee”: user that is able to see inventory items and prices, and move items into orders (Read and update)<br>
“Viewer”: user who can only view inventory items (View)


## User Personas
Owner Persona
- Owner of the (auto shop) business and the database.
- Older in age, not as tech-savvy. Might know how to use a phone well but not a computer.
- Currently not using inventory software which makes it difficult to manage inventory.
- Our app would be simple enough to use for these types of owners, but also useful.
Manager Persona
- 2nd in command of the business and takes over when the owner is not there.
- Possibly younger, a little more tech-savvy.
- Keeps track of inventory needs vs what’s already in stock.
- Needs enough power to fully manage the database. 
Employee Persona
- Is in charge of keeping track of parts that come in
- Would update the database when parts arrive
Can also update the database when parts are used
Viewer Persona
A person that only requires viewing powers and cannot edit the database.
Less trustworthy or just doesn’t need editing powers. Possibly a receptionist or part-timer?


## User Stories

As an Owner, I want orders up to date of customers’ desires and the ability to manipulate invoices so that customers can be billed with no conflicts with our inventory

As a Manager, I want to add/remove items in my inventory and manipulate their prices for all invoices my orders to be up to date with my inventory, adding and removing items to the inventory so that all customers do not have surprises/wait times for re-stocks and long shipping times when due dates come

As a Employee, I want to be able to update item status in the inventory to let admin/manager know what has arrived vs what’s running out

As a viewer, I want to be able to see the availability and information of the store’s products, so that I can provide customers with accurate, precise quotes on part availability and costs (excluding labor costs).
