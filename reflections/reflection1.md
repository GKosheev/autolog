## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 One successful thing this week has been being able to get our database hosted by Google Cloud! Using Google cloud to host our database was a new feat we managed to successfully implement and can't wait to have filled with data from real auto body shops.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some challenges our group faced this week included knowing where to start, at first we opted to go for frontend but realizing now how crucial backend is to our project, we will now prioritize having it ready, to then move on to the frontend.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We almost finished all tasks but missed small but critical points that will be the complete focus next week in order to have a first version that could go into production and pushed from development branch to the main branch

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

With so many things in our project, it was definitely a challenge as the scope is unclear when so many pieces are missing, but TA's helped a lot on how to handle collaborative projects with a short explanation this week and examples on how to do enhancement tickets. Furthermore, team communication was excellent so it helped to avoid merge conflicts and settle down what to tackle.

Besides, in this project specifically, things such as items depend on inventories which, in turn, depend on users so it was hard to try to maintain a steep momentum in productivity in not just the general application but the MVP. However, all the other features such as styling will help us have a really polished application in no time with the backend and frontend logic is nearly completed.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

A possible user story at risk is the manager user role, as they have a lot of power just like the owner would, meaning we would have to choose between either distinguishing the two roles more or just allow for the manager to request for access to the database but not have power to delete it. 

In terms of features, we don't necessarily have any core features that are at risk, although we do have stretch features we would love to implement. Some of these stretch features that we believe we can accomplish include having a relog feature that would go off if the user has been inactive for a certain time period (which would improve security), setting an order system to let shops know what items have been ordered but in transit vs what has already arrived.
